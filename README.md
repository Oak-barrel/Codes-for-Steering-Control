# Codes for autonomous driving tasks

Content:

- Semantic segmentation codes (based on pytorch, author: Li Xiaoxiao, modified: Hou Yuenan)

- Steering angle prediction codes (based on Tensorflow, author: Hou Yuenan, state: to be released)

- Lane detection codes (based on Torch, author: Pan Xinggang, modified: Hou Yuenan, state: to be written)


To do list:

- Clean all codes, make them readable and reproducable

- Put codes of steering angle prediction (tensorflow) and lane detection (torch and pytorch) here

- Attach original experimental results here to facilitate future research
